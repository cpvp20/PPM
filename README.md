# PPM

PPM (Portable PixMap) is an image format. One of its versions, the P3, stores images in the form of text files (characters with ASCII code). This challenge uses a small part of the possibilities offered by this format.

The first task is to read a .ppm file and store its contents in an instance of a PPMFile abstract data type (including its implementation). The next challenge is to process/manipulate the image in 4 different ways (including the dithering method) and save each version as a new .ppm file.
